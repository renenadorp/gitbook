## Classification Techniques

Classification techniques are used in supervised learning

| Technique               | Hypothesis | Loss Function        |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Bayesian                |            |                      |
| Decision Trees          |            |                      |
| Random Forest           |            |                      |
| Support Vector Machines |            |                      |
| K-Nearest Neighbour     |            |                      |
| Linear Regression       | y=aX+b     | MSE                  |
| Logistic Regression     | sigmoid    | binary cross entropy |
|                         |            |                      |
